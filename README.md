# BenBot
My Arduino based game with 4x integrated LED/Button.

The year was 2021 and the big Christmas meetup was soon approaching. It was Christmas tradition to partake in secret
Santa but this year was different. We had been tasked with making our present through means of a craft.
Being not particularly crafty I endeavoured to create something with electronics and code.

Benbot has 4x integrated LED/Buttons and I made 3 different games. Two of them are memory games and the third is a 
game to test a users reactions.
The code runs on an Arduino Nano Every, which I'm actually very impressed with. Its so small but has so much capability.
I enjoyed writing in their C based code which has great documentation.

Me and the old man 3D printed an enclosure and I added a battery box so the game can run without being connected via 
micro USB. I used a panel mount USB cable to allow a user to connect to the Arduino without having to open up the
enclosure.

I may add a list of all parts used as it would be cool for people to use this project and make cool games of their own.
